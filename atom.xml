    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>I have a lot of dreams about basketball</h3>
<p>
	I had two dreams last night. First dream I was playing basketball and I was able to slice and drive to the rim with no opposition, but it wasn&#8217;t because I was playing well I just felt that the defense was not trying. I was basically playing against lazy people, but at one point I dunked the ball and fell asleep hanging on the rim, so I started bending the rim. I ended up bending the rim, all the way down, and then I tried to bend it back and then woke up. 
</p>
<p>
	Ok next dream was fucked up as shit. So essentially, it started of with me and bunch of people were taking a coding test, there was a proctor, but unless we finished the tests, or finished all the programs, we couldn&#8217;t leave the room. So we could write in any language we wanted, but all of a sudden, this guy next to me was like fuck this, and he water bended at the proctor. Like in The Last Airbender shit. So I don&#8217;t know what was going on in my mind but like each language corresponded to a &#8220;element&#8221;, so C++ was water, and Java was fire. I don&#8217;t remember what air was but the proctor basically went full evil mode like MWAHAHAHAHAHA mode and he earth bended and rekked everyone in the room and somehow his powers reminded me of Python. Before I woke up, I think I was like begging to be spared because I had used Python on my test so maybe this crazy dude would spare me.
</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Spring break finally started, so either I&#8217;ll use this extra time to make higher quality posts for all of my 3 readers, or I&#8217;ll just embrace my laziness.
</p>
<p>
	This morning I actually had a pretty interesting dream but I was too lazy to write it down. All I remember was this time I wasn&#8217;t participating in my dream, I was simply watching it unfold upon me from inside my head.
</p>
<h2>Pi day</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/pies_3_14.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Happy Pi day. Don&#8217;t deny my R^2 Pi huehue. Anyways, friend swiped me in to dining court this morning and since Purdue is fat(phat) as fuck, look at these fucking pies. Ok top left, standard pumpkin pie. Not that interesting, but good nontheless. Bottom left, we got some coconut cream pie. Very light, but also very sweet. Strong coconut flavor. Top right, is it really a pie if its just chocolate pudding? Well it&#8217;s like chocolate pudding on the standard graham cracker crust, and its topped with some peanut butter m & m&#8217;s mmm.  Now the bottom right, this one was a fucking delicacy. So everyone&#8217;s familiar with mint chocolate chip ice cream, so this green colored filling is kind of like mint flavored pudding and its fucking good. Underneath that its not crust, its chocolate fudge. Yea you heard it here first.
</p>
<p>mmmm Liver</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/liver_3_13.png" width="400" height="400">
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_13.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Liver looks gross. But liver is fucking good. But it also tastes like fucking liver. But you know what I really enjoyed, look at the little bit of red shit at the top of the picture. That&#8217;s the blood I harvested from the liver and turned in to a sauce. No I&#8217;m kidding that&#8217;s just some chili garlic sauce that I have that reminded me of home. NOT SIRACHA, that chili sauce that comes in a little container on the tables of chinese restaurants.
</p>
<h3>I swear I&#8217;m not a girl</h3>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/wine_3_13.png" width="200" height="200">
<p>
	Drank this with my roomate. It basically tastes like sprite. Good stuff overall though I have to say.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Ok so when I woke up this morning I actually deemed my dream to be worthy of posting, but maybe that&#8217;s just because I had fun in my dream. So it&#8217;s like almost 12 AM right now, so I have extremely faded memories of what I dreamed about last night. Going of my notes I wrote this morning, I was playing in the 3 on 3 basketball tournament that my high school would always host. Except I was playing in my current body, so I was basically having the time of my life dunking on high school kids. The other thing I wrote down this morning was studying&#8230;. so fuck that. 
</p>
<h2>I love breakfast</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_12.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Eggs, cajun sausage, onions, spinach. Peanut butter sandwich not shown. I wonder when I&#8217;ll get tired of this breakfast.
</p>
<p>
	I know I haven&#8217;t posted much about school or any code snippets and stuff like that, but my excuse is because I&#8217;ve been pretty busy this week. But I&#8217;ll be writing a script that does a Denial of Service attack soon so look forward to that.
</p>
<h2>Some nice spaghetti</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_12.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Doesn&#8217;t look to special but this is cooked with 4 slices of bacon so its fucking good.
</p>
<h3>Last stop on the struggle bus</h3>
<p>
	So I had a midterm on semiconductors today, and this is one of the reasons I sometimes I did computer science instead of computer engineering. But anyways, someone got rekked today, he was caught cheating. The professor brough his test down to the bottom of the lecture hall and yelled, &#8220;This kid is wasting his parent&#8217;s money.&#8221; Pretty scary, pretty harsh. 
</p>
<h2>Harpoon IPA</h2>
<p>
	Recently turned 21 so I started sampling different kind of beers with my roomie.
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/beer_3_12.png" width="350" height="350">
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/beer_cup_3_12.png" width="350" height="350">
<p>
	So this beer is an IPA, which I guess makes it more fancy, or more legit? I don&#8217;t really know because I don&#8217;t know too much about beers. But when we opened it, it definitly had a fruity scent to it. Maybe not exactly fruity, but it had a pleasent, nature like sent to it. And the taste was very interesting. I&#8217;ve never had another beer that tasted like it. It was initially sweet, but immediately became bitter. But the bitter wasn&#8217;t unpleasent, it was interesting and it stuck to my toungue.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I actually remembered my dream but I deemed it unworthy.</p>
<h2>Subway (LOL)</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/lunch_3_11.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	I forgot to take a picture of my breakfast this morning so instead, here&#8217;s a picture of a foot long spicy italian from subway. I can&#8217;t believe they don&#8217;t do freaking five dollar footlongs anymore. Spicy Italian used to be straight up 5 dollars, now it&#8217;s $5.50 plus tax which is SO BULLSHIT.
</p>
<p>
	So today I went to the Purdue student health clinc today to get my knee checked. The freaking physician I got was a freaking weirdo. All I wanted to do was get my knee checked and gtfo so I could study for my tests but he kept making really stupid Bill Clinton jokes and really stupid jokes in general. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was threatened or uncomfortable, but the entire expereince was really annoying. I felt like I was being like a kid.
</p>
<h2>Lentils</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_11.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	So today I figured out why my lentils were staying as cooked lentils in runny water instead of the lentils being cooked and becoming like a thick soup along with the water. It&#8217;s because you need to cook the lentils with salt! The salt &#8220;mashes&#8221; up the lentils for you.
</p>
<h3>Struggle bus stop 4</h3>
<p>
	Took my computer security test today which I knew was going to be absolute rekk so after being absolutely rekked, I didin&#8217;t feel too bad.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	Sorry if anyone has been expecting me to post a crazy dream, but I haven&#8217;t had one worth posting in a while.
</p>
<h2>What do you even call this</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_10.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Gotta eat big breakfasts on Tuesdays because no time for lunch. Its that sausage (cajun) , spinach, onion, egg goodness. And you already know I&#8217;m all about that peanut butter. I&#8217;m trying to finish this smooth shit so I can eat my super crunchy shit.
</p>
<h3>Struggle bus stop 2</h3>
<p>
	So my second test of this week was actually not that bad. Considering the labs in this class are so considerate that they could singlehandly make you fail the class, the midterms aren&#8217;t that bad. Part of the exam was to draw some huge rtl block diagram from some verilog code. I finished the exam pretty quickly. When I handed it to my TA, the first thing he did was flip straight to my diagram and chuckle. After that I was like this is bullshit and I just booked it, I think he was just trolling me though. 
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing a lot of smash in the HKN loungue. I wish I had my controller here.</p>
<h3>Struggle bus stop 3</h3>
<p>
	Why is history so hard all of a sudden. I actually didin&#8217;t know a a bunch of questions on today&#8217;s quiz. I got 100% on the first part of this class, why is the second part so hard. I guess founding fathers are more interesting than the Soviets.
</p>
<h2>Asian style drumsticks</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_10.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	So does this mofo make chicken drumsticks every day. Cause they were ON SALE at the butcher block. So today I made them ASIAN style. I put Sha Cha Jiang and that chili peanut oil stuff along with soy sauce on them. And some ponzu for some acid flavor. You know you have to get the entire flavor palette going. Also carrots and brocolli taste really good when they&#8217;re roasted in the oven.

<p>
	It&#8217;s the week before spring break and my professors decided to schedule all their tests this week. I&#8217;m not even on quarter system so why do I have a finals week before my spring break. This is some bullshit. First test was in my probabilistic methods class. The material was ok but the test tore me a new asshole because half the problems were on the one topic I chose to not review as closely as I could of.

<h2>Party time with $4 vege burritos</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/lunch_3_9.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Four dollars for all this is pretty good, but I will admit Fiesta is getting old. But I enjoy catching up to all my Indian friends that always come during the four dollar special on mondays. And god dam Akshay was supposed to pay for me today cause I spotted him last time but he ran out of money again so I had to spot him again. Fuck you Akshay. 
</p>
<p>
	After consulting a fair amount of people I also decided to work at Amazon during the summer as a Software Developer Intern. See you mofos in SF. Fucking Akshay didin&#8217;t even know what mofo meant and he was just throwing the phrase around.
</p>
<h2>Baked Indian Style Chicken Drumsticks</h2>
<p>
	Baked chicken drumsticks again but this time with indian flavors. And by indian flavors all I mean is I just put some Garam Masala, Coriander, and Chili Powder on my chicken.
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_9.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
Recipe:
	<ul>
		<li>Ingredients:</li>
		<li>chicken drumsticks: however many you want</li>
		<li>Bacon: however much you like bacon</li>
		<li>Chopped carrots</li>
		<li>Chopped Broccolli</li>
		<li>Coriander Powder, Chili Powder, Garam Masala</li>
		<li>Fry Bacon on pan until the pan gets covered with the bacon grease</li>
		<li>Brown the chicken in the grease for some arbitray amount of time. Just look at how brown it is. When you think it&#8217;s brown enough then you&#8217;re guchi.</li>
		<li>Mix the powders with ample salt and pepper, and just sprinkle that shit all over the chicken.</li>
		<li>Put the veges on top</li>
		<li>Sprinkle more seasoning mixture.</li>
		<li>Pore some water in to the pan. Don&#8217;t ask me how much, just look at the pan to figure it out.</li>
		<li>Throw that shit in to an oven around like 450 degrees. I cooked for the time it took Trump to play 2 games of Hearthstone. But maybe 1.5 games would have been enough.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>You end up with some ballin carrots and broccolli, and some fineeeee as chicken. Assuming you cooked it for the right amount of time. But the more you cook, the more intuitive it gets to find out how long to cook things for. </p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Double post today since I missed a post yesterday because I was at a hackathon.
<h3>Zombie Apocalypse</h3>
<p>
	I actually had to do a google search on apocalypse to make sure I spelled it correctly and magically I did. But this dream was freaking brazy, yea, crazy not brazy. So brazy I remembered it even it was two nights ago. So I me and my buddy Erik were somewhere in China visiting our buddy Jason. And everything seemed really normal, just chilling and going around China but for some reason we spent a lot of time on the subways. Like the the only places that felt safe in the country were on the subways, but even then, there was some kind of uncomfortable aura from being on the subway. Somehow, the entire universe we were in became some sort of zombie apocalypse world. In my dreams I&#8217;m always thrown in to these being chased situations where I have to run away. So Erik and I were actually with a bunch of other people and we were running away but they couldn&#8217;t keep up with me cause we had to parkor over trucks for some reason, so I guess I just kept running and I left them behind. I didin&#8217;t ditch them, I just needed to figure out a way out of this. I saw a family of four enter a bathroom and then I saw a light flash from underneath the door. I opened the bathroom door and they were gone, all that was left was a menu on the toilet seat. On the menu was an option for &#8220;go home.&#8221; So I guess I just ordered that and I was teleported back home. But then I knew I had to go back and get Erik and the others so I used the menu to order myself back in to the zombie world&#8230;. I ran out of the bathroom holding the menu and I saw the others and they said &#8220;Anthony! we found a way to get back home! We have to hold each other&#8217;s hand and run to Wal-Mart where there&#8217;s a portal!&#8221; Well I said fuck that cause I have this menu.
</p>
<h2>Tortilla Espanola (kind of)</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_6.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>Basically an egg omlette with bacon, spinach, SAUSAGE, and rice.</p>
<h2>Hack the Anvil</h2>
<p>
	Went to an hackathon with my buds, but I guess I don&#8217;t have the same fire as the other hackers there so we left early. I mean I really enjoy programming and creating new things, and trying out new technologies, but I guess I do enjoy it enough to go for 36 hours straight. I mean, I want to play basketball and eat real food, not the chain store pizza they provide for us. But it was still a good expereince, I got to try out a Myo, which is an arm band that reacts to different ways you flex your arm, to send specific inputs to a program.
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/myo_3_6.png" width="400" height="400">
<h2>the next day</h2>
<p>
	Ok so my dream from last night, which was after the hackathon, involved me doing pushups and somehow kicking my mom in the face. So we&#8217;ll just leave it at that.
</p>
<h2>Boiler Block Bacon</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_7.png" width="350" height="350">
<p>
	Made an actual omlette today instead of my weird half scramble half omlette thing. And some nice, meaty bacon from the Purdue butcher shop. And I also like peanut butter.
</p>
<p>
	I have 5 consecutive midterms the following week so I mainly just studied today. Gotta know those pdfs, cdfs, and pmfs. But at the same time that didin&#8217;t stop me from playing 4 hours of basketball today. UGHHHHHHH
</p>
<h2>Spaghetti cooked in meat juice</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_7.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	So I had some leftover meat juice from cooking that huge ass steak the other day, as well as the steak, so I decided to cook the spaghetti in that meat juice. This was hands down the best fucking spaghetti I&#8217;ve ever made for myself. I think everything should just be cooked in meat juice.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
	I deemed my dream good enough to take notes on it in the morning, so let&#8217;s see if I can recall it based on my notes. Ok so there&#8217;s this one plaza in cupertino or sunnyvale or I don&#8217;t even know where somewhere around that area, and that plaza has like a Japanese store, and a beard papa. So I was driving there to meet my family, but my car was driving freaking weird, it had no handling. So if you&#8217;ve played mario kart before, it&#8217;s like my car had like a handling rating of 1 out of 10. I couldn&#8217;t make turns for shit. But like I said before I don&#8217;t simply dream, I freaking expereince the feelings, so imagine driving a car that you can&#8217;t turn, and you can&#8217;t slow down, on a regular road. But whatever I finally make it to the dam blaza and there&#8217;s a gym like barbell brigade, bart kwan&#8217;s gym, except everyone working out in the gym was naked. So there were people walking around in the parking lot naked so I don&#8217;t know, instead of going what the fuck I actually was just like ok I&#8217;m down and went to work out in there. All I really remember was the dream was fucking crazy, and this one person had boobs as muscles, if you can imagine that. Also next door was a store selling like pounds of smoked turkey wrapped in plastic wrap. I just kept thinking of fermented meat when I woke up.
</p>
<h2>Breakfast Tacos</h2>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_5.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	Only had one egg today so I couldn&#8217;t make the usual. I needed to eat some carbs also because I had to skip lunch, so insert the tacos.
</p>
<h2>steak on steak on steak</h2>
<p>
	So I had a cut of beef that was about 1.5ft long and 1ft wide so the only way to cook it was in the oven. I pretty much steamed it for around 10 minutes and then braised it dry for another ten minutes and it came out perfect. My camera sucks (or I suck at taking pictures).
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/beef_3_5.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	It&#8217;s sitting in its own meat juice, and the inside of that marrow is all melted (can&#8217;t wait to eat that). Cut up with some brocolli for health.
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_5.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	My dad sent me this cute little thing.
</p>
<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/hotsauce_3_5.png" width="350" height="350">
<p>
	As you can see its only 22mL. I thought it would be crazy spicy, but it&#8217;s actually really good. It&#8217;s actually really dam good. Its not like those other habanero sauces that just focus on being spicy, or other hot sauces that are overly vinergry. This sauce just straight up tastes like chilis, it has flavor, and it&#8217;s spicy without being overwhelming.

	Unfortunately I can&#8217;t remember my dream from last night. I remember remembering it in the morning but I must have deemed it not interesting enough to note.
</p>
<h2>Cashew Butter</h2>
<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_3_3.png" width="350" height="350">
	The only difference today is that the bread has cashew butter on it instead of peanut butter. 
</p>
<p>
	So why am I a penguin? Well because my campus turned in to the antarctic. We had tons of snow the past couple days, and when that shit melts, it leaves hella puddles on the ground and leaves the sidewalks and roads completely covered in water. Night comes, and BAM the campus becomes a ice rink. I stepped outside my apartment complex this morning and basically slid from my door to the beginning of the steps. I managed to get down the steps by tightly gripping the frozen hand rail, and then proceeded to shuffle my way to class. Not even boots can help you in these conditions, your need straight up cleats.
</p>
<h2>Qdoba</h2>
<p>

</p>
<h2>&nbsp</h2>
<p>
	So queso and chips are usually like 4 dollars extra on top of waht you pay for a burrito bowl at Qdoba but if you ask for nachos with all the stuff that goes in a burrito bowl, its the equivilant of getting a burrito bowl with a side of nachos. Freaking amazing. theres like a pool of spicy melted cheese under all that in bowl, and they give you a shit ton of chips. It&#8217;s not particularly healthy but I fills me up for 8 dollars and that&#8217;s not something most places can claim. 
</p>
<p>
	I also had a nice talk with my friend Akshay. Shit that guys got it all planned out. Work after graduation until he&#8217;s 35. Move back to India and start his own company until he&#8217;s 55. He&#8217;s gonna be married at 24 or 26 latest. He knows how much money he wants in his bank account when he&#8217;s at certain ages. All I know is Keenan telling me that my bank of america account got 6 figures.
</p>
<h2>Chicken Thighs in Bacon Fat</h2>
<img class="left" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/chicken_3_3.png" width="370" height="370">
<img class="right" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_3.png" width="370" height="370">
<h2>&nbsp</h2>
<p>
	From the sound it makes in the pan to the how it looks on the plate to how good it is, this chicken is bomb. Unghhhh. The onions are nice after being baked along with the chicken. And of course brocolli for health. 
</p>
<h2>Mixing it up</h2>
<p>
	Mixed it up with some box jumps. I&#8217;m about 5&#8217;10&#8221;, which is pretty short in the Midwest. But anyways, the box is about up to my clavicle so I&#8217;d say this is around a 5 foot jump.

<h3>Grand theft of my breath</h3>
	<p>
		All right you guys are in for a fucking story today, I actually remembered my dream and wrote stuff to help me remember. First of all, in a lot of my dreams I&#8217;m typically put in to the kind of scenario similar to GTA. If you&#8217;ve played GTA before, if you don&#8217;t have cheats enabled, when you actually get wanted stars, the police chase after you and you actually have to hide. But that&#8217;s just a video game, imagine you&#8217;re in that scenario in your dream. When I dream, they&#8217;re lucid in the sense that I&#8217;m conscious of whats going on, and the fact that I&#8217;m dreaming, but not in the sense where I can control my dream. I can control my actions, but within the real life limits of the scene I&#8217;m dumped in to. So I&#8217;m part of some 4 man hunter team and we&#8217;re wanted by the police and we&#8217;re at my old high school. We&#8217;re sneaking around and I just feel it in my heart that we&#8217;re fucked so I just book it and run through the school, through class rooms and doors and gyms and climbing shit and I eventually make it and hide in a tree. The thing is I actually feel the nervousness and heart papulations you would get if this was actually happening. For some reason I&#8217;m always fucking running away from something in my dreams.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second part of my dream was even more fucked up. I&#8217;m still part of this four man team, but we&#8217;re thrown in some labyrinth to hunt another 4 man team. Or rather, we&#8217;re also being hunted. So we had some gear where we could share vision with each other, so I saw when one of my team mates was pinned against a wall staring down the barrel of an enemy charging her laser beams. But because this is a dream, my teammate did something absolutely crazy and somehow opened a dimension portal where she was and where another enemy was and swapped positions. So then the enemy was going to shoot her own teammates. But my teammate fucked up and the portal she opened closed on her arm, but she didin&#8217;t lose her arm, she just lost the soul within her arm&#8230; So she tried to recover it by siphoning some soul from another teammate. But that teammate was being hunted and he was hiding from his hunter by making clones of himself so his hunter could not figure out which was the real one, but when my first teammate tried linking her soul with him, it gave away which of the clones was real. I was thinking to myself shit she fucked everything up, and then I woke up. Dreams pretty fucking real&#8230;.

		Remeber when I said my group wanted to make a GPU on an FPGA. Well we decided since we know nothing about FPGAs and nothing about GPUs we&#8217;re just going to do triple DES encryption on an FPGA instead. That way we&#8217;re only completely clueless on half the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also started replaying Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones today, that games bomb.

	<p>
		Working on the chest today so I made some chicken for lunch. 
		I think the best way to impart flavor on meat isn&#8217;t with a marinade, or seasoning, or sauce, but my perfectly cooking the meat to exact tenderness. Exact doneness. Not overcooked or undercooked, but precisely cooked. And that is what you see here. FUCK YEAAAAA (Ok it&#8217;s a tad undercooked but I was hungry)
	</p>
	<p>
		I&#8217;ll post some recipes enventually.

	<h2>Informatica Interview</h2>
	<p>
		So I had a second round interview with Informatica today for the software developer position, and I felt decently confident going in to it because I had already been offered by Amazon (pure luck). I&#8217;m pretty confident with all data structure oreinted questions, but today I was thrown a pretty big curve ball and I just ended up being stomped on. I don&#8217;t know if I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it today, but either way this was pretty humbling.
	</p>
	<p>
		Given an n-ary tree where root nodes can have multiple children, nodes can share children, and children can share parents, reverse the tree and return a list of the leaf nodes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I couldn&#8217;t solve it within the time limit, and even after working out the problem after the interview, I still don&#8217;t fully understand it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Here&#8217;s a good <a href="http://www.careercup.com/question?id=12219054">thread</a> on the question.

	<h2>Chinese Smoked Beef</h2>
	<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_3_2.png" width="400" height="400">
	<p>
		So my dad sent me some chinese style smoked beef brisket. So unlike the American BBQ style brisket, the chinese or perhaps taiwanese style is alot firmer. Also it&#8217;s usually eaten chilled or at room temperature. But the point is it&#8217;s fucking good and its fucking dense and I might have eaten like a full pound of it for dinner. It&#8217;s hiding under the brocolli which I added to help push the beef out the other end. 
	</p>
</div>
<p>
	I was kinda sad beacuse the Warriors lost today, freaking Jarret Jack. But shout out to Captain Kirk for making me feel better.

<h3>I support GMOs in my dream</h3>
<div>
	So last night I came up with an awesome invention, pasta that changes color based on the heat of the sauce. By heat I mean spiciness. So if you have some tomato sauce, the actual spaghetti, or in my dream it was like the spiral pasta you get from sweet tomatoes or soupplantation, gets more red depending on the spiciness of the sauce. So maybe like the flour has some molecule that can detect capsaicin or something and that releases a red pigment. Ok it&#8217;s pretty stupid but I can see this being pretty popular. 
	</div>
<h2>Got some new sausage</h2>
<p>

</p>	
<h2>&nbsp</h2>
<div>
	As promised, I got some new sausages. Tailgater&#8217;s brats straight from the boilermaker butcher block. I don&#8217;t rememebr the flavor profile but I do know it was dam good. Added some ketchuip and siracha on my eggs, and you know I like that penaut butter slightly melted. 
</div>
</br>
<p>If anyone knows about OrCad and using Pspice with that, fuck that shit.</p>
<h2>Smoked Chicken Leg</h2>
<p>
	<img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_2_28.png" width="350" height="350">
</p>
<p>
	So my dad sent me some bomb ass smoked chicken leg. He literally wrapped that shit in plastic wrap and sent it half way across the country hoping it would not spoil, and thank god it didin&#8217;t cause it was dynamite. And I made some bacon and chicken spaghetti with some tomato sauce, but the pasta wasn&#8217;t from my dream unfortunately. Brocolli for &#8220;health&#8221;
</p>
</br>
<p>
	Oh if anyone is really familiar with the Chinese Remainder Theorem hit me up cause I need some help with that.
</p>
</br>
<p>
	I&#8217;ve been balling every day this week since I&#8217;m taking a break from lifting. So I have a little blurb every day. Today I matched up with this huge black dude cause I was the tallest on my team. But this guy was like 6&#8217;3&#8221; and I&#8217;m 5&#8217;10&#8221; on a good day and when he was backing me down his ass was straight in my chest. But after the game he told me I gave him a lot of trouble on defense so even though I felt I was being backed down by Shaq I guess I still played some good D.

	<h3>Secret Saudi Dance Party</h3>
	<div>
		Ok so the dream started of with me walking towards my apartment from the electrical engineering lab and somehow I saw my buddy Allen from back home. Like this guy is straight out of my home town and I&#8217;d consider him one of my closest friends. He says he&#8217;s here on a secret spy mission and I end up taking him to the Stewert Center where there&#8217;s a secret dance bar and inside the bar there&#8217;s a secret room where he has to dance to prevent the launching of missles. On the way there we pass the Saudi Arabian Embassy somehow. We enter the dance bar and it&#8217;s quite empty. There were only a couple of circles formed but no one was really going at it. All of a sudden Allen transforms in to a female version of himself and then he starts going nuts randomly on the floor by himself. Somehow we make it to the secret room where I was put in charge of running test benches for underclassmen code and for some reason my life was on the line if they worked or not. So I decided to also dance but I felt super weak and could not pull of any of my typical moves and then Allen transformed in to some fusion of my girlfriend Theresa and Byron where that 	person would not cuddle with me and was constantly playing some stupid iteration of the online game Tera.
		<br/>
		I&#8217;m just rambling but that&#8217;s what it is bois.

	<h2>Ran out of sausage</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_2_27.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		Mixing it up with some store bought on sale bacon and some sunny side up eggs. Messed one up cause I cracked it from too high.
	</div>
	<h2>RSA Cryptography</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/rsa_2_27.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		I worked on writing a script that performs RSA cryptography encryption and decryption for the better part of my day, so if you&#8217;re wondering how the keys are generated this is it. Totient is a funny word hehe.
	</div>
	<h2>I ain&#8217;t Indian Lentils</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/lunch_2_27.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		Tried making some lentils today, but I used too much water and the consistency was messed up. It&#8217;s got garam masala, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. And of course spinach for &#8220;health&#8221;.
	</div>
	<div>I&#8217;m outta control</div>
	<div>
		Played ball with my buds today. So much more fun when you&#8217;re playing with everyone you know, the team dynamic awesome. Not gonna lie I was going hard and going off today, a little like Brodie.
	</div>
	<div><video  preload='metadata' controls ><source src='http://anthonykang.github.io/videos/bbal_2_28.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'></video></div>
	<div>
		Except I&#8217;m not Brodie so the result is now my knee hurts like a mofo.
	</div>
	<h2>Coupons for days</h2>
	<div>
		Now usually you all know I&#8217;m about that healthy life (spinach), but when you got buy one get one coupons for McDonalds, you know what it is.
	</div>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_2_27.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		Nutritional content claims I had almost 2000mg of sodium, which must explain why I&#8217;m so thirsty right now.
	</div>
	<h2>Boring Hearthstone Meta</h2>
	<div>
		Hearthstone is such a drag right now. Everyclass runs a max of 2 viable lists for the ladder and the game is so predictable. If both you and your opponent know how to play your decks correctly, it simply becomes a matchup and hand draw coinflip. I&#8217;m not an expert, that&#8217;s just my opinion from watching the recent tournaments as well as from my experiences on the ladder. And off course there&#8217;s Dr. Bitch.

	I freaking had three episodes of dreams last night but I messed up and didin&#8217;t write them down before making breakfast so I only remember one. I&#8217;m going to start setting up the tomorrow&#8217;s posts so I can just slap them down on the post in the morning.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h3>I&#8217;m transferring???</h3>
	<div>
		So the only dream I remember involved me getting an email in my Purdue email saying that I&#8217;m being transferred to a private local college back home, and I had no choice but to go. When I arrived in my hometown, all my buds from home had been extracted from their respecitve colleges and we were forced to take a placement test. So this isn&#8217;t very exciting, but the thing is that I remember the test with such detail. I was doing freaking combinatorics problems, drawing RTL diagrams, writing code, and doing IQ test questions. When I woke up I actually said wtf because at one point I was deriving a formula for a summation on paper, like that&#8217;s shit I can&#8217;t even do when I&#8217;m awake&#8230; I&#8217;m sure my other dreams were more #action_packed but I had to make breakfast. 
	</div>
	<h2>It has bread this time</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_2_26.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		Last cajun suasage. I promise you guys I&#8217;ll get a different kind of sausage tomorrow. I had some peanut butter sandwiches today too since I had to skip lunch. I&#8217;ll admit I licked the melted peanut butter off my wrists like a savage.
	</div>
	<h2>My chuttigabro Utpal</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/state_diagram_2_26.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		So I had a totally messed up state diagram drawing so when I was creating the controller module I already knew I was fucked. So shoutout to my TA Utpal for drawing this masterpiece of a state transition diagram for me.
	</div>
	<h2>Ball is life?</h2>
	<div>
		So the team I played with the first couple games today could hardly inbound the ball&#8230; We made these guys look like the Golden State Warriors.
	</div>
	<div><video  preload='metadata' controls ><source src='http://anthonykang.github.io/videos/sloppy_gif_2_26_converted.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'></video></div>
	<div>
		Later my asian niggas came and we styled on the opposition so that was good. People at Purdue take too many stop up threes. No one ever wants to run the good ol pick and roll or cut to the rim. But everyone plays with really good effort so the games are still awesome. We&#8217;re lucky we have ten courts at our rec center. 
	</div>
	<h2>Spaghetti Carbonara (not really)</h2>
	<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_2_26.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
	<div>
		The only Carbonara thing about this pasta was that I used bacon. But I also used the leftover roast pork I had so the porkfat melted in with the bacon fat and then what more can I say. I added some spinach and red onion to make it healthy.

		So I&#8217;ve been playing this game on my phone called Crossy Street where you&#8217;re basically a cute little animal and you try to cross streets frogger style.

		I told you guys I eat this shit every dam day. I&#8217;m excited to wake up in the morning and eat this. I promise I&#8217;ll have new type of sausage soon I&#8217;m running out of the cajun ones. But today I found a freaking size large egg in my box of jumbo eggs. Dam Purdue market tryna rip me.

	<div>
		Today&#8217;s software tools lab challenge for my ECE364 class was to write a bunch of functions to parse an XML document with regex. If you&#8217;ve used regex before, then it&#8217;s obvious how powerful it can be, but also how convuluted the patterns can be. I mean, look at this ip address match:

		Maybe I&#8217;m weird but I think coming up with Regex patterns is kind of fun heheh. After lab me and my chut Jakshay went to get some gyros.
		<h2>Captain Gyro</h2>
		<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/lunch_2_25.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
		<div>
			Its harder to find diversified cuisine here in Indiana but Captain Gyro is an exception. It&#8217;s owned by some old dude straight out of Greece and he&#8217;s got one of those rotating spools of gyro meat and he shaves that shit straight in to some pita bread and its on point. The sandwich here is has extra vegetables (gotta get that fiber) but its filled with meat. No nonsense homemade gyro&#8217;s.

		<h2>Sit Down Boi</h2>

		<div>
			I wish I knew what I was getting myself in to when I said I wanted to be a computer engineer. I was not ready to deal with all this hardware stuff. Who the hell wants to write a test bench for this monstrosity. Looking at the mapped design makes me need to sit down. I&#8217;ll probably appreciate timing problems and meta stable states as I progress&#8230;or maybe not. 
		</div>
		<h2>Bacon Fried Rice</h2>
		<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_2_25.png" width="450" height="450"></div>
		<div>
			You can&#8217;t see the bacon but that shit was on sale and it&#8217;s in there and yes its good. All you see are veggies cause I&#8217;m all about those veggies. I&#8217;ll break out the wok one day to make some legit fried rice but today I was just hungry so this is all there is. Ok, I&#8217;m eating some thin mints as I write this.

Didn&#8217;t remember my dream from last night. Circuits suck. Stared at a breadboard for two hours only to realize the circuit wasn&#8217;t working because my transistor had blown. The hardware struggles of a software oriented computer engineer continues. But enough of that, on to the food (I need to work on plating).

<h2> Cajun Sausage Disco Eggs </h2>
<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/breakfast_2_24.png" width="500" height="500"></div>
<div> Pretty much make this every morning. It&#8217;s fucking good and it lasts me until lunch. Gotta have that breakfast. </div>
<br/>
<div>I had a homemade roast pork sandwich for lunch but that wasn&#8217;t worth taking a picture of. Currently using my phones camera which is quite&#8230;.. shitty.</div>
<br/>
<h2> Soy Sauce Roast Pork </h2>
<div><img class="center" src="http://anthonykang.github.io/images/dinner_2_24.png" width="500" height="500"></div>
<div> Meat, rice, and brocolli. The plating sucks but it tastes good I swear. It&#8217;s easy to make too, I&#8217;ll try to get a recipe up eventually.</div>
<br/>
<h2> Daily Workout </h2>
<div>Wanted to get a video of a 4 plate pull but definitly wasn&#8217;t feeling it today. Form was already struggling with 315 x 5. Going to take a break from lifting for a week and probably just play ball. I think I need a better chair for my desk cause my back&#8217;s been feeling like an old man&#8217;s. </div>
