<div class="entry-content">Double post today since I missed a post yesterday because I was at a hackathon.
<h3>Zombie Apocalypse</h3>
<p>
	I actually had to do a google search on apocalypse to make sure I spelled it correctly and magically I did. But this dream was freaking brazy, yea, crazy not brazy. So brazy I remembered it even it was two nights ago. So I me and my buddy Erik were somewhere in China visiting our buddy Jason. And everything seemed really normal, just chilling and going around China but for some reason we spent a lot of time on the subways. Like the the only places that felt safe in the country were on the subways, but even then, there was some kind of uncomfortable aura from being on the subway. Somehow, the entire universe we were in became some sort of zombie apocalypse world. In my dreams I&#8217;m always thrown in to these being chased situations where I have to run away. So Erik and I were actually with a bunch of other people and we were running away but they couldn&#8217;t keep up with me cause we had to parkor over trucks for some reason, so I guess I just kept running and I left them behind. I didin&#8217;t ditch them, I just needed to figure out a way out of this. I saw a family of four enter a bathroom and then I saw a light flash from underneath the door. I opened the bathroom door and they were gone, all that was left was a menu on the toilet seat. On the menu was an option for &#8220;go home.&#8221; So I guess I just ordered that and I was teleported back home. But then I knew I had to go back and get Erik and the others so I used the menu to order myself back in to the zombie world&#8230;. I ran out of the bathroom holding the menu and I saw the others and they said &#8220;Anthony! we found a way to get back home! We have to hold each other&#8217;s hand and run to Wal-Mart where there&#8217;s a portal!&#8221; Well I said fuck that cause I have this menu.
</p>
<h2>Tortilla Espanola (kind of)</h2>
<img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_6.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>Basically an egg omlette with bacon, spinach, SAUSAGE, and rice.</p>
<h2>Hack the Anvil</h2>
<p>
	Went to an hackathon with my buds, but I guess I don&#8217;t have the same fire as the other hackers there so we left early. I mean I really enjoy programming and creating new things, and trying out new technologies, but I guess I do enjoy it enough to go for 36 hours straight. I mean, I want to play basketball and eat real food, not the chain store pizza they provide for us. But it was still a good expereince, I got to try out a Myo, which is an arm band that reacts to different ways you flex your arm, to send specific inputs to a program.
</p>

<h2>the next day</h2>
<p>
	Ok so my dream from last night, which was after the hackathon, involved me doing pushups and somehow kicking my mom in the face. So we&#8217;ll just leave it at that.
</p>
<h2>Boiler Block Bacon</h2>
<img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_7.png" width="350" height="350">
<p>
	Made an actual omlette today instead of my weird half scramble half omlette thing. And some nice, meaty bacon from the Purdue butcher shop. And I also like peanut butter.
</p>
<p>
	I have 5 consecutive midterms the following week so I mainly just studied today. Gotta know those pdfs, cdfs, and pmfs. But at the same time that didin&#8217;t stop me from playing 4 hours of basketball today. UGHHHHHHH
</p>
<h2>Spaghetti cooked in meat juice</h2>
<img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_7.png" width="400" height="400">
<p>
	So I had some leftover meat juice from cooking that huge ass steak the other day, as well as the steak, so I decided to cook the spaghetti in that meat juice. This was hands down the best fucking spaghetti I&#8217;ve ever made for myself. I think everything should just be cooked in meat juice.
