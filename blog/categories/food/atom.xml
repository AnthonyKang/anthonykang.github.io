        So I&rsquo;ve been playing this game on my phone called Crossy Street where you&rsquo;re basically a cute little animal and you try to cross streets frogger style. So I dreamt I was a dam duck trying to cross a street full of cars trying to kill me. And some dude in my dream kept trying to tell me that closing tags were unnecessary. Nightmares of making pages with Jade I guess.

    <h2> Cajun Sausage Eggs (Again) </h2>
    <div><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_2_25.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
    <div>
        I told you guys I eat this shit every dam day. I&rsquo;m excited to wake up in the morning and eat this. I promise I&rsquo;ll have new type of sausage soon I&rsquo;m running out of the cajun ones. But today I found a freaking size large egg in my box of jumbo eggs. Dam Purdue market tryna rip me.

        Today&rsquo;s software tools lab challenge for my ECE364 class was to write a bunch of functions to parse an XML document with regex. If you&rsquo;ve used regex before, then it&rsquo;s obvious how powerful it can be, but also how convuluted the patterns can be. I mean, look at this ip address match:
        <div>
            <figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">m</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">r&#39;(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)(.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}:([0-9]{1,4}|[12][0-9]{4}|3[01][0-9]{3}|32[0-6][0-9]{2}|327[0-5][0-9]|3276[0-7])&amp;lsquo;,line)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
        </div>
        Maybe I&rsquo;m weird but I think coming up with Regex patterns is kind of fun heheh. After lab me and my chut Jakshay went to get some gyros.
        <h2>Captain Gyro</h2>
        <div><img class="center" src="/images/lunch_2_25.png" width="350" height="350"></div>
        <div>
            Its harder to find diversified cuisine here in Indiana but Captain Gyro is an exception. It&rsquo;s owned by some old dude straight out of Greece and he&rsquo;s got one of those rotating spools of gyro meat and he shaves that shit straight in to some pita bread and its on point. The sandwich here is has extra vegetables (gotta get that fiber) but its filled with meat. No nonsense homemade gyro&rsquo;s.
        </div>
        <h2>Sit Down Boi</h2>
        <div><img class="center" src="/images/lab_2_25.png" width="450" height="450"></div>
        <div>
            I wish I knew what I was getting myself in to when I said I wanted to be a computer engineer. I was not ready to deal with all this hardware stuff. Who the hell wants to write a test bench for this monstrosity. Looking at the mapped design makes me need to sit down. I&rsquo;ll probably appreciate timing problems and meta stable states as I progress&hellip;or maybe not.
        </div>
        <h2>Bacon Fried Rice</h2>
        <div><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_2_25.png" width="450" height="450"></div>
        <div>
            You can&rsquo;t see the bacon but that shit was on sale and it&rsquo;s in there and yes its good. All you see are veggies cause I&rsquo;m all about those veggies. I&rsquo;ll break out the wok one day to make some legit fried rice but today I was just hungry so this is all there is. Ok, I&rsquo;m eating some thin mints as I write this.<br/>

<div>
Didn&#8217;t remember my dream from last night. Circuits suck. Stared at a breadboard for two hours only to realize the circuit wasn&#8217;t working because my transistor had blown. The hardware struggles of a software oriented computer engineer continues. But enough of that, on to the food (I need to work on plating).

<h2> Cajun Sausage Disco Eggs </h2>


<div><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_2_24.png" width="500" height="500"></div>


<div> Pretty much make this every morning. It&#8217;s fucking good and it lasts me until lunch. Gotta have that breakfast. </div>


<p><br/></p>

<div>I had a homemade roast pork sandwich for lunch but that wasn&#8217;t worth taking a picture of. Currently using my phones camera which is quite&#8230;.. shitty.</div>


<p><br/></p>

<h2> Soy Sauce Roast Pork </h2>


<div><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_2_24.png" width="500" height="500"></div>


<div> Meat, rice, and brocolli. The plating sucks but it tastes good I swear. It&#8217;s easy to make too, I&#8217;ll try to get a recipe up eventually.</div>


<p><br/></p>

<h2> Daily Workout </h2>


<div>Wanted to get a video of a 4 plate pull but definitly wasn&#8217;t feeling it today. Form was already struggling with 315 x 5. Going to take a break from lifting for a week and probably just play ball. I think I need a better chair for my desk cause my back&#8217;s been feeling like an old man&#8217;s. </div>
