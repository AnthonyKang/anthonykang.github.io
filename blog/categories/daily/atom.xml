    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    This is about to be a long ass post. My lovely girlfriend came to visit me and we took a weekend trip to chicago. All you guys can hate me about how I&#8217;m just documenting my own fun but whatever here&#8217;s some nice food. 
</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/sbwt1.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Theresa finally arrived so that means I get kisses now :D
<img class="center" src="/images/sbwt2.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Next day we got up bright and early to take the Greyhound to Chicago. Look at her sad face cause she can&rsquo;t handle the cold.
<img class="center" src="/images/sbwt3.jpg" width="400" height="400">
So I guess I couldn&rsquo;t handle the cold that well either. So I wore her beanie and now I look like a cancer patient. #CAkids
<img class="center" src="/images/sbwt4.JPG" width="400" height="400">
First stop gotta get some deep dish. Theresa&rsquo;s never been to Chicago before so gotta hit up the touristy stuff first! Deep dish is always good you gotta use a knife and fork to cut through the thick ass cheese, sausage, and pie crust.
<img class="center" src="/images/sbwt5.JPG" width="400" height="400">
Then we went to the buckingham fountain but it was off because it was pretty cold that day, which means the water could freeze and bust the pipes. Unfortunate, but still nice nonetheless.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9150.jpg" width="400" height="400">
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9142.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Then we went to the bean like proper Chicago tourists. This place always has so many god dam people. Its actually pretty crazy. There&rsquo;s finger prints all over the Bean, but nevertheless it&rsquo;s still really cool.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9162.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Then a nice long and cold ass stroll down the magnificent mile. We stopped by Eatly on the way, which is this crazy awesome and authentic Italian store/market/brewery but there were way too many people to take pictures, and sometimes you just gotta enjoy what you&rsquo;re looking at.</p>

<h3>Holy Fucking Crisp</h3>


<p>This was probably the best meal of the entire trip.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9188.jpg" width="400" height="400">
So this place is called Crisp. Its like a Korean chicken wing place and it&rsquo;s incredible. The menu is nice and simple, all it has is wings, a few different kinds of BimBimBap, and some Korean sides. This place was packed to shit as well. So what you see here were some delicious Korean red miso bbq wings and some soy, ginger, what ever asian combination but it was good as fuck and we ate like savages. Also the kimchi was good and offered a nice acidic balance to our meal. I recommend getting some rice though, because the wings are really really flavorful.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9193.JPG" width="400" height="400">
We are savages. ^</p>

<h3>Beercade</h3>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9197.JPG" width="400" height="400">
This place is called Headquarters. Its a beercade, so there&rsquo;s tons of old arcade games and pinball machines inside. All the games were free too, we didin&rsquo;t even have to buy a drink. But we did get this draft beer I totally forgot what it was called, but it was also the first time I ever bought a drink. Or rather Theresa bought it for me haha. But they gave it to us in this glass, and I&rsquo;ve never had beer in a glass before. But it was hands down one of the best beers I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life. It was so full of flavor and the bitterness that accompanied it was actually very very nice. Here&rsquo;s a picture of me playing at a pinball machine.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9194.jpg" width="400" height="400">
As we were walking back to the subway, we passed by an empanada shop called 5411 and we spontaneously decided to have some. Pretty good but kind of expensive.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9200.JPG" width="400" height="400">
Next day we went to chinatown. Haven&rsquo;t had some legit chinese food in a while so this was nice.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9202.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Got some BO LUO BAO MMMMM. Filling on inside AND outside.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9204.JPG" width="400" height="400">
Fried chinese donut wrapped in rice noodle with a sweet soy dipping sauce. $2.99
I didin&rsquo;t get any pictures, but Chinatown in Chicago actually has some pretty crazy shops. Besides the millions of herbal shops that sell shit for like a million dollars a pound, there was this one shop that sold like cs go knives. And machetes. And axes.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9217.JPG" width="400" height="400">
Then we had some of this stuff. Looks simple but the flavor was exquisite.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9230.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Then we went to the sky deck. They have this clear balcony where you can go out on and it feels like you&rsquo;re out on top of Chicago. The weather was kinda meh but still it was really cool. I actually think it was worth the money to go up, the entire tour is nice and the view is impressive.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9258.JPG" width="400" height="400">
So we went to Little Saigon for dinner. And there&rsquo;s this little place at the end of the streeet that&rsquo;s famous for these two noodle dishes. The tomato based one on the left side is called Bun Rieu. The main attraction is the crab meat shrimp stuff. And the right side is called Bun bo Hue and its got delicious pork blood and a pigs knuckle. The broth of both soups were just so god dam good even compared to the ones I&rsquo;ve had back home in California. Absolutely amazing.
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9260.JPG" width="400" height="400">
<img class="center" src="/images/IMG_9261.jpg" width="400" height="400">
Then we went to this ice cream place called Jennis. We got three different flavors, dark chocolate, cappucino, and like almond brown butter. Of course I&rsquo;m simplifying this down a little its really like dark dark super dark I&rsquo;m from South America Chocolate, and <em>some fancy coffee brand</em> cappucino, but yea you get my point. But really we only needed one flavor and that was the dark chocolate it was so dam good. After this we went to a fancy as fuck bar that I don&rsquo;t even have pictures for because cell phones are not allowed in the main area! It was so fancy I couldn&rsquo;t believe it I think the only thing we discussed was how dam fancy it was.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>I have a lot of dreams about basketball</h3>


<p>
    I had two dreams last night. First dream I was playing basketball and I was able to slice and drive to the rim with no opposition, but it wasn&#8217;t because I was playing well I just felt that the defense was not trying. I was basically playing against lazy people, but at one point I dunked the ball and fell asleep hanging on the rim, so I started bending the rim. I ended up bending the rim, all the way down, and then I tried to bend it back and then woke up. 
</p>


<p>
    Ok next dream was fucked up as shit. So essentially, it started of with me and bunch of people were taking a coding test, there was a proctor, but unless we finished the tests, or finished all the programs, we couldn&#8217;t leave the room. So we could write in any language we wanted, but all of a sudden, this guy next to me was like fuck this, and he water bended at the proctor. Like in The Last Airbender shit. So I don&#8217;t know what was going on in my mind but like each language corresponded to a &#8220;element&#8221;, so C++ was water, and Java was fire. I don&#8217;t remember what air was but the proctor basically went full evil mode like MWAHAHAHAHAHA mode and he earth bended and rekked everyone in the room and somehow his powers reminded me of Python. Before I woke up, I think I was like begging to be spared because I had used Python on my test so maybe this crazy dude would spare me.
</p>


<h2>Meals for the day</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_15.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>My bread is so messed up because it&#8217;s impossible to spread chunky peanut butter.</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_15.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>Baked some chicken wings and carrots. I wish I had some rosemary though.</p>

    <id>http://anthonykang.github.io/blog/2015/03/14/spring-break</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Spring break finally started, so either I&#8217;ll use this extra time to make higher quality posts for all of my 3 readers, or I&#8217;ll just embrace my laziness.
</p>


<p>
    This morning I actually had a pretty interesting dream but I was too lazy to write it down. All I remember was this time I wasn&#8217;t participating in my dream, I was simply watching it unfold upon me from inside my head.
</p>


<h2>Pi day</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/pies_3_14.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Happy Pi day. Don&#8217;t deny my R^2 Pi huehue. Anyways, friend swiped me in to dining court this morning and since Purdue is fat(phat) as fuck, look at these fucking pies. Ok top left, standard pumpkin pie. Not that interesting, but good nontheless. Bottom left, we got some coconut cream pie. Very light, but also very sweet. Strong coconut flavor. Top right, is it really a pie if its just chocolate pudding? Well it&#8217;s like chocolate pudding on the standard graham cracker crust, and its topped with some peanut butter m & m&#8217;s mmm.  Now the bottom right, this one was a fucking delicacy. So everyone&#8217;s familiar with mint chocolate chip ice cream, so this green colored filling is kind of like mint flavored pudding and its fucking good. Underneath that its not crust, its chocolate fudge. Yea you heard it here first.
</p>


<p>mmmm Liver</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/liver_3_13.png" width="400" height="400">
<img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_13.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Liver looks gross. But liver is fucking good. But it also tastes like fucking liver. But you know what I really enjoyed, look at the little bit of red shit at the top of the picture. That&#8217;s the blood I harvested from the liver and turned in to a sauce. No I&#8217;m kidding that&#8217;s just some chili garlic sauce that I have that reminded me of home. NOT SIRACHA, that chili sauce that comes in a little container on the tables of chinese restaurants.
</p>


<h3>I swear I&#8217;m not a girl</h3>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/wine_3_13.png" width="200" height="200"></p>

<p>
    Drank this with my roomate. It basically tastes like sprite. Good stuff overall though I have to say.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
    Ok so when I woke up this morning I actually deemed my dream to be worthy of posting, but maybe that&#8217;s just because I had fun in my dream. So it&#8217;s like almost 12 AM right now, so I have extremely faded memories of what I dreamed about last night. Going of my notes I wrote this morning, I was playing in the 3 on 3 basketball tournament that my high school would always host. Except I was playing in my current body, so I was basically having the time of my life dunking on high school kids. The other thing I wrote down this morning was studying&#8230;. so fuck that. 
</p>


<h2>I love breakfast</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_12.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Eggs, cajun sausage, onions, spinach. Peanut butter sandwich not shown. I wonder when I&#8217;ll get tired of this breakfast.
</p>


<p>
    I know I haven&#8217;t posted much about school or any code snippets and stuff like that, but my excuse is because I&#8217;ve been pretty busy this week. But I&#8217;ll be writing a script that does a Denial of Service attack soon so look forward to that.
</p>


<h2>Some nice spaghetti</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_12.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Doesn&#8217;t look to special but this is cooked with 4 slices of bacon so its fucking good.
</p>


<h3>Last stop on the struggle bus</h3>


<p>
    So I had a midterm on semiconductors today, and this is one of the reasons I sometimes I did computer science instead of computer engineering. But anyways, someone got rekked today, he was caught cheating. The professor brough his test down to the bottom of the lecture hall and yelled, &#8220;This kid is wasting his parent&#8217;s money.&#8221; Pretty scary, pretty harsh. 
</p>


<h2>Harpoon IPA</h2>


<p>
    Recently turned 21 so I started sampling different kind of beers with my roomie.
</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/beer_3_12.png" width="350" height="350">
<img class="center" src="/images/beer_cup_3_12.png" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p>
    So this beer is an IPA, which I guess makes it more fancy, or more legit? I don&#8217;t really know because I don&#8217;t know too much about beers. But when we opened it, it definitly had a fruity scent to it. Maybe not exactly fruity, but it had a pleasent, nature like sent to it. And the taste was very interesting. I&#8217;ve never had another beer that tasted like it. It was initially sweet, but immediately became bitter. But the bitter wasn&#8217;t unpleasent, it was interesting and it stuck to my toungue. 
</p>

    <id>http://anthonykang.github.io/blog/2015/03/11/creepy-doctor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I actually remembered my dream but I deemed it unworthy.</p>


<h2>Subway (LOL)</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/lunch_3_11.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    I forgot to take a picture of my breakfast this morning so instead, here&#8217;s a picture of a foot long spicy italian from subway. I can&#8217;t believe they don&#8217;t do freaking five dollar footlongs anymore. Spicy Italian used to be straight up 5 dollars, now it&#8217;s $5.50 plus tax which is SO BULLSHIT.
</p>


<p>
    So today I went to the Purdue student health clinc today to get my knee checked. The freaking physician I got was a freaking weirdo. All I wanted to do was get my knee checked and gtfo so I could study for my tests but he kept making really stupid Bill Clinton jokes and really stupid jokes in general. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was threatened or uncomfortable, but the entire expereince was really annoying. I felt like I was being like a kid.
</p>


<h2>Lentils</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_11.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    So today I figured out why my lentils were staying as cooked lentils in runny water instead of the lentils being cooked and becoming like a thick soup along with the water. It&#8217;s because you need to cook the lentils with salt! The salt &#8220;mashes&#8221; up the lentils for you.
</p>


<h3>Struggle bus stop 4</h3>


<p>
    Took my computer security test today which I knew was going to be absolute rekk so after being absolutely rekked, I didin&#8217;t feel too bad.
