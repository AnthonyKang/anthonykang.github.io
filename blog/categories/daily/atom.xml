    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This morning I actually remembered my dream but I deemed it unworthy.</p>


<h2>Subway (LOL)</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/lunch_3_11.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    I forgot to take a picture of my breakfast this morning so instead, here&#8217;s a picture of a foot long spicy italian from subway. I can&#8217;t believe they don&#8217;t do freaking five dollar footlongs anymore. Spicy Italian used to be straight up 5 dollars, now it&#8217;s $5.50 plus tax which is SO BULLSHIT.
</p>


<p>
    So today I went to the Purdue student health clinc today to get my knee checked. The freaking physician I got was a freaking weirdo. All I wanted to do was get my knee checked and gtfo so I could study for my tests but he kept making really stupid Bill Clinton jokes and really stupid jokes in general. I wouldn&#8217;t say I was threatened or uncomfortable, but the entire expereince was really annoying. I felt like I was being like a kid.
</p>


<h2>Lentils</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_11.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    So today I figured out why my lentils were staying as cooked lentils in runny water instead of the lentils being cooked and becoming like a thick soup along with the water. It&#8217;s because you need to cook the lentils with salt! The salt &#8220;mashes&#8221; up the lentils for you.
</p>


<h3>Struggle bus stop 4</h3>


<p>
    Took my computer security test today which I knew was going to be absolute rekk so after being absolutely rekked, I didin&#8217;t feel too bad.

    Sorry if anyone has been expecting me to post a crazy dream, but I haven&#8217;t had one worth posting in a while.
</p>


<h2>What do you even call this</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_10.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Gotta eat big breakfasts on Tuesdays because no time for lunch. Its that sausage (cajun) , spinach, onion, egg goodness. And you already know I&#8217;m all about that peanut butter. I&#8217;m trying to finish this smooth shit so I can eat my super crunchy shit.
</p>


<h3>Struggle bus stop 2</h3>


<p>
    So my second test of this week was actually not that bad. Considering the labs in this class are so considerate that they could singlehandly make you fail the class, the midterms aren&#8217;t that bad. Part of the exam was to draw some huge rtl block diagram from some verilog code. I finished the exam pretty quickly. When I handed it to my TA, the first thing he did was flip straight to my diagram and chuckle. After that I was like this is bullshit and I just booked it, I think he was just trolling me though. 
</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve also been playing a lot of smash in the HKN loungue. I wish I had my controller here.</p>


<h3>Struggle bus stop 3</h3>


<p>
    Why is history so hard all of a sudden. I actually didin&#8217;t know a a bunch of questions on today&#8217;s quiz. I got 100% on the first part of this class, why is the second part so hard. I guess founding fathers are more interesting than the Soviets.
</p>


<h2>Asian style drumsticks</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_10.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    So does this mofo make chicken drumsticks every day. Cause they were ON SALE at the butcher block. So today I made them ASIAN style. I put Sha Cha Jiang and that chili peanut oil stuff along with soy sauce on them. And some ponzu for some acid flavor. You know you have to get the entire flavor palette going. Also carrots and brocolli taste really good when they&#8217;re roasted in the oven.

<p>
    It&#8217;s the week before spring break and my professors decided to schedule all their tests this week. I&#8217;m not even on quarter system so why do I have a finals week before my spring break. This is some bullshit. First test was in my probabilistic methods class. The material was ok but the test tore me a new asshole because half the problems were on the one topic I chose to not review as closely as I could of.
</p>


<h2>Party time with $4 vege burritos</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/lunch_3_9.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    Four dollars for all this is pretty good, but I will admit Fiesta is getting old. But I enjoy catching up to all my Indian friends that always come during the four dollar special on mondays. And god dam Akshay was supposed to pay for me today cause I spotted him last time but he ran out of money again so I had to spot him again. Fuck you Akshay. 
</p>


<p>
    After consulting a fair amount of people I also decided to work at Amazon during the summer as a Software Developer Intern. See you mofos in SF. Fucking Akshay didin&#8217;t even know what mofo meant and he was just throwing the phrase around.
</p>


<h2>Baked Indian Style Chicken Drumsticks</h2>


<p>
    Baked chicken drumsticks again but this time with indian flavors. And by indian flavors all I mean is I just put some Garam Masala, Coriander, and Chili Powder on my chicken.
</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_9.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
Recipe:
    <ul>
        <li>Ingredients:</li>
        <li>chicken drumsticks: however many you want</li>
        <li>Bacon: however much you like bacon</li>
        <li>Chopped carrots</li>
        <li>Chopped Broccolli</li>
        <li>Coriander Powder, Chili Powder, Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Fry Bacon on pan until the pan gets covered with the bacon grease</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken in the grease for some arbitray amount of time. Just look at how brown it is. When you think it&#8217;s brown enough then you&#8217;re guchi.</li>
        <li>Mix the powders with ample salt and pepper, and just sprinkle that shit all over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Put the veges on top</li>
        <li>Sprinkle more seasoning mixture.</li>
        <li>Pore some water in to the pan. Don&#8217;t ask me how much, just look at the pan to figure it out.</li>
        <li>Throw that shit in to an oven around like 450 degrees. I cooked for the time it took Trump to play 2 games of Hearthstone. But maybe 1.5 games would have been enough.</li>
    </ul>
</p>


<p>You end up with some ballin carrots and broccolli, and some fineeeee as chicken. Assuming you cooked it for the right amount of time. But the more you cook, the more intuitive it gets to find out how long to cook things for. </p>

Unfortunately, I can&rsquo;t celebrate until next week because I have 5 midterms this coming week :[. Didin&rsquo;t do much today besides study and work out with kevin. I think I&rsquo;m getting better at making these baked chicken drumsticks though.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Double post today since I missed a post yesterday because I was at a hackathon.</p>

<h3>Zombie Apocalypse</h3>


<p>
    I actually had to do a google search on apocalypse to make sure I spelled it correctly and magically I did. But this dream was freaking brazy, yea, crazy not brazy. So brazy I remembered it even it was two nights ago. So I me and my buddy Erik were somewhere in China visiting our buddy Jason. And everything seemed really normal, just chilling and going around China but for some reason we spent a lot of time on the subways. Like the the only places that felt safe in the country were on the subways, but even then, there was some kind of uncomfortable aura from being on the subway. Somehow, the entire universe we were in became some sort of zombie apocalypse world. In my dreams I&#8217;m always thrown in to these being chased situations where I have to run away. So Erik and I were actually with a bunch of other people and we were running away but they couldn&#8217;t keep up with me cause we had to parkor over trucks for some reason, so I guess I just kept running and I left them behind. I didin&#8217;t ditch them, I just needed to figure out a way out of this. I saw a family of four enter a bathroom and then I saw a light flash from underneath the door. I opened the bathroom door and they were gone, all that was left was a menu on the toilet seat. On the menu was an option for &#8220;go home.&#8221; So I guess I just ordered that and I was teleported back home. But then I knew I had to go back and get Erik and the others so I used the menu to order myself back in to the zombie world&#8230;. I ran out of the bathroom holding the menu and I saw the others and they said &#8220;Anthony! we found a way to get back home! We have to hold each other&#8217;s hand and run to Wal-Mart where there&#8217;s a portal!&#8221; Well I said fuck that cause I have this menu.
</p>


<h2>Tortilla Espanola (kind of)</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_6.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>Basically an egg omlette with bacon, spinach, SAUSAGE, and rice.</p>


<h2>Hack the Anvil</h2>


<p>
    Went to an hackathon with my buds, but I guess I don&#8217;t have the same fire as the other hackers there so we left early. I mean I really enjoy programming and creating new things, and trying out new technologies, but I guess I do enjoy it enough to go for 36 hours straight. I mean, I want to play basketball and eat real food, not the chain store pizza they provide for us. But it was still a good expereince, I got to try out a Myo, which is an arm band that reacts to different ways you flex your arm, to send specific inputs to a program.
</p>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/myo_3_6.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<h2>the next day</h2>


<p>
    Ok so my dream from last night, which was after the hackathon, involved me doing pushups and somehow kicking my mom in the face. So we&#8217;ll just leave it at that.
</p>


<h2>Boiler Block Bacon</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/breakfast_3_7.png" width="350" height="350"></p>

<p>
    Made an actual omlette today instead of my weird half scramble half omlette thing. And some nice, meaty bacon from the Purdue butcher shop. And I also like peanut butter.
</p>


<p>
    I have 5 consecutive midterms the following week so I mainly just studied today. Gotta know those pdfs, cdfs, and pmfs. But at the same time that didin&#8217;t stop me from playing 4 hours of basketball today. UGHHHHHHH
</p>


<h2>Spaghetti cooked in meat juice</h2>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/dinner_3_7.png" width="400" height="400"></p>

<p>
    So I had some leftover meat juice from cooking that huge ass steak the other day, as well as the steak, so I decided to cook the spaghetti in that meat juice. This was hands down the best fucking spaghetti I&#8217;ve ever made for myself. I think everything should just be cooked in meat juice.
